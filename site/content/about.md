If you’re a web publisher using WordPress and looking for ways to use data to better understand your audience,  send me a message or say hi on Twitter and let’s see how I can help you.

I love working with WordPress and doing it the right way. Themes and plugins I develop have a common #1 goal: Making it as easy as possible for users to publish web content.

First got in touch with WordPress back in 2007, as a WordPress.com blogger, then ran a self-hosted, WordPress.org blog, and finally moved into WordPress development in 2009. In 2014 I started learning about web analytics, and have been helping web publishers use analytics to their advantage.

Occasionally I blog about WordPress and have had my posts published at Search Engine Journal, WPExplorer, Wptuts+ and Torque Mag.

Work experience:

* WordPress plugin developer and customer support at Krokedil, November 2014 – Present
* CTO at Alpha Brand Media (Search Engine Journal), May 2013 – April 2015
* WordPress developer at ThematoSoup, January 2011 – August 2014
* Freelance WordPress developer, February 2009 – April 2013

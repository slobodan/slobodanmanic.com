Clutter makes me uncomfortable. Some people can achieve peak productivity regardless of their environment, I am not among them. Physical clutter is one thing - if something is there and it shouldn't be at, it is literally in the way - digital clutter is worse.

Countless HTTP requests, most of them unnecessary, menus longer than $5 subs, themes with unlimited options, plugins and plugins to extend plugins, these can all serve a purpose, but in reality huge majority of people do not need any of it.

Clutter is why I migrated this site from WordPress to Hugo.

The setup is beautiful. I push the changes to a GitHub repo, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) takes care of everything else. If you want to know more about what happens behind the scenes, read this [guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/21/a-step-by-step-guide-victor-hugo-on-netlify/).

Static sites are not for everyone. Some command line work is required when setting up the site. There is no (good) one click installation, but there's a lot of great guides that can help you. Once you figure that out, there's no logins, plugins, security issues, only writing.
